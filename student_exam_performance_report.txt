## üìò **Student Exam Performance Analysis using NumPy**

---

### üß≠ **1. Objective**

The goal of this project is to analyze how various student habits ‚Äî such as **hours studied**, **sleep duration**, and **attendance percentage** ‚Äî influence **final exam performance**.
Using **NumPy**, this project demonstrates efficient data handling, numerical computation, and conditional analysis.

### üóÇÔ∏è **2. Dataset Description**

* **File Used:** `student_exam_scores.csv`
* **Rows:** (Number of students)
* **Columns:**

  1. Student ID
  2. Hours Studied
  3. Sleep Hours
  4. Attendance %
  5. Previous Scores
  6. Exam Score

The dataset provides behavioral and academic data points that can be analyzed for performance insights.

### üìä **3. Analysis Steps**

1. **Data Loading:** Imported the CSV file using `np.genfromtxt()` with `skip_header=1` to exclude column names.
2. **Descriptive Statistics:** Computed **mean**, **max**, **min**, and **standard deviation** for each numerical variable.
3. **Correlation Analysis:** Used `np.corrcoef()` to identify which study factors are most correlated with exam performance.
4. **Grading:** Applied nested `np.where()` conditions to classify students into grades A, B, C, D, or F.
5. **Group Comparison:** Compared **High vs Low** groups for Study Hours, Attendance, and Sleep based on their mean values.
6. **Insights & Conclusion:** Summarized overall trends and findings for data interpretation.

Variable                  Mean       Max        Min        Std       
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Hours Studied             6.33       12.00      1.00       3.22      
Sleep Hours               6.62       9.00       4.00       1.49

### üîó **5. Correlation Analysis**

Correlation Analysis
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Hours Studied             0.78      
Sleep Hours               0.19      
Attendance Percentage     0.23      
Previous Scores           0.43 

üß† **Interpretation:**
Higher study hours and attendance show strong positive correlation with exam performance. Sleep hours show weak or slightly negative correlation, suggesting sleep alone does not directly increase marks.

Group Performance Comparison
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Factor               High Avg             Low Avg              Difference          
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Hours Studied        38.80                29.40                9.40                
Average Attendances  34.96                32.93                2.04                
Average Sleep        35.01                32.84                2.17

üß† **Interpretation:**
‚Ä¢ Students who studied more hours scored on average +9.4 marks higher.
‚Ä¢ Students with better attendance performed +6.3 marks better.
‚Ä¢ Sleep hours had minimal effect or a slight negative difference (‚àí1.4).

### üìä **8. Key Insights**

* Study commitment and consistent attendance have the **strongest impact** on exam success.
* Sleep patterns alone do not strongly predict performance.
* Students with above-average study time and attendance achieve **significantly higher exam scores**.
* The overall pass percentage indicates the class performed moderately well, with room for improvement in preparation habits.

### üß† **10. Conclusion**

This project shows how numerical computation in **NumPy** can reveal meaningful patterns in educational data.
The analysis confirms that **hours studied** and **attendance percentage** are the most influential factors for student success, while **sleep hours** have limited direct correlation.
This framework provides a foundation for expanding into **Pandas-based analysis**, **visualization (Matplotlib)**, or **predictive modeling (Scikit-Learn)**.
